This is a logical answer, however I can't find manual that confirms it

Mark in command line will suspend thread at stdout if thread will try to execute it. Otherwise all the rest of thread 
processes will execute as normal (until stdout)
This makes sense when you trying to copy output, not to have it "running away" from your cursor.
