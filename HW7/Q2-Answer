Because static is serializable it can be written by ObjectOutputStream because of:
  "Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable interface can be written to streams.
  The class of each serializable object is encoded including the class name and signature of the class,
  the values of the object's fields and arrays, 
  and the closure of any other objects referenced from the initial objects."
